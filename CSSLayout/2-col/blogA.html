                <p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. (Sustained cheers, applause.) </p>
                <p>Tonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny, the task of perfecting our
                union moves forward. (Cheers, applause.)</p>
                <p>
                    It moves forward because of you. It moves forward because you reaffirmed the spirit that has triumphed over war and depression,
                    the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that while each
                    of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family, and we rise or fall together as one nation and as
                    one people. (Cheers, applause.)
                </p>
                <p>
                     Tonight, in this election, you, the American people, reminded us that while our road has been hard, while our journey has
                    been long, we have picked ourselves up, we have fought our way back, and we know in our hearts that for the United States
                    of America, the best is yet to come.
                </p>
                <p>
                     (Cheers, applause.) I want to thank every American who participated in this election. (Cheers, applause.) Whether you voted
                    for the very first time (cheers) or waited in line for a very long time (cheers) – by the way, we have to fix that – (cheers,
                    applause) – whether you pounded the pavement or picked up the phone (cheers, applause), whether you held an Obama sign or
                    a Romney sign, you made your voice heard and you made a difference. (Cheers, applause.)
                </p>
                <p>
                     I just spoke with Governor Romney and I congratulated him and Paul Ryan on a hard-fought campaign. (Cheers, applause.) We
                    may have battled fiercely, but it's only because we love this country deeply and we care so strongly about its future. From
                    George to Lenore to their son Mitt, the Romney family has chosen to give back to America through public service. And that
                    is a legacy that we honour and applaud tonight. (Cheers, applause.) In the weeks ahead, I also look forward to sitting down
                    with Governor Romney to talk about where we can work together to move this country forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                     I want to thank my friend and partner of the last four years, America's happy warrior, the best vice-president anybody could
                    ever hope for, Joe Biden. (Cheers, applause.) And I wouldn't be the man I am today without the woman who agreed to marry
                    me 20 years ago. (Cheers, applause.) Let me say this publicly. Michelle, I have never loved you more. (Cheers, applause.)
                    I have never been prouder to watch the rest of America fall in love with you too as our nation's first lady. (Cheers, applause.)
